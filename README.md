# DiseaseModel
A Python Project for modeling the spread of a disease

This model was created during the summer of 2020 in order for me to practice Python Coding 
with a fun project. In Febuary 2021, I added some statistical data charts to add insight to 
the initial project. Please see "Disease Model Report" for a brief overview!
